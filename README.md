# COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Tableau

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of COVID-19 data specific to India using Tableau. The data was sourced from Kaggle and additional geographic information was retrieved from GitHub. The analysis covers various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including state-wise death tolls, age group details for confirmed cases, vaccine administration, testing details, and more.

## Dataset
COVID-19 Data: The primary dataset was obtained from Kaggle and includes information on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, and vaccination details across India.
Indian State Boundaries: A shapefile containing the boundaries of Indian states was downloaded from GitHub to create geographic visualizations.

## Analysis
The following key analyses were performed using Tableau:

1. Total Deaths by State in India
A map visualization highlighting the total number of deaths across various states in India.
2. Age Group Details for Confirmed Cases
A breakdown of confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group, providing insights into the most affected age demographics.
3. Line Chart for Confirmed, Cured, and Death Cases by State
A time-series line chart showing trends in confirmed, cured, and death cases across different states.
4. Vaccine Administration Analysis
Analysis of the doses administered by different vaccines, showing the progress of the vaccination drive.
5. Number of ICMR Labs by State
A state-wise breakdown of the number of ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) labs, which played a crucial role in COVID-19 testing.
6. Gender-wise Confirmed Cases
Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases by gender, highlighting the impact of the pandemic across different genders.
7. First vs. Second Dose Administered
Comparison of the administration of the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, showcasing the vaccination completion rate.
8. State-wise Testing Details
Detailed analysis of testing across states, including the total number of samples tested, and the breakdown of negative and positive cases.
